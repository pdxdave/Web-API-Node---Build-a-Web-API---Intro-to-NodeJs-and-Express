Web API: Node - Build a Web API - Intro to NodeJs and Express

#### Q: What is Node.js?  
#### A: Node.js is a runtime environment (a program that runs other programs), a platform used to execute JavaScript applications outside the browser.

Some of the advantages of using Node.js for writing server side code are:    

- JavaScript on the server: use the same programming language and paradigm for both client and server. This minimizes context switching and makes it easy to share code between the client and the server.    
- Single-threaded: removes the complexity involved in handling multiple threads.    
- Asynchronous: can take full advantage of the processor it’s running on. This matters because the node process will be running on a single CPU.    
- Npm repository: access the largest ecosystem of useful libraries (most of them free to use) in the form of npm modules.    

Some of the disadvantages of using Node.js for writing server-side code are:    

JavaScript on the server: we lose the ability to use the right tool (language) for the job.    
single-threaded: can’t take advantage of servers with multiple cores/processors.    
asynchronous: it is harder to learn for developers that have only worked with languages that default to synchronous operations that block the execution thread.    
npm repository: too many packages that do the same thing makes it harder to choose one and, in some cases, may introduce vulnerabilities into our code.
